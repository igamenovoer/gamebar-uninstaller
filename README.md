# Gamebar Uninstaller

If you have a decent PC but gaming performance is unexpectedly unstable, experiencing unpredictable frame drops and stutters, you are probably a victim of the Xbox Gamebar, particularly the GameBarPresenceWriter.

This script helps you to remove xbox gamebar in your Windows system, so as to:
- prevent the gamebar presence writer (`GameBarPresenceWriter.exe`) from starting ([this problem](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/gamebar-presence-writerexe-gamingservices-why-cant/bb38539e-9228-42b0-8b7c-0bd044e92ca8)), which causes serious frame drops for some games.
- prevent the annoying "missing ms-gamebar link" dialog pops up ([this problem](https://www.reddit.com/r/WindowsHelp/comments/1h2cagi/xbox_gamebar_windows_11_help_removing_get_an_app/)), whenever a gamepad is plugged in

This script automates many tricks scattered around different forums ([this](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackdesertonline/comments/16ajlwe/psa_disable_gamebar_presence_writer/), [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucH-Tp7OY2M), [this](https://superuser.com/questions/1743650/powershell-how-to-disable-xbox-game-bar), and many others), thanks to their efforts.

The powershell script is created with the help of gemini, so use at your own risk.

Open an administrative powershell and run this script ([how to enable execution of powershell script](https://superuser.com/questions/106360/how-to-enable-execution-of-powershell-scripts)), then just follow the steps.

Good luck
